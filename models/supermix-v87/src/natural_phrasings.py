"""How a person actually types a question, for the twelve solver-verified tasks.

## The measurement this exists to move

v74 carried **one** template per task. It scored 0.894 on its own benchmark --
which generates prompts in the corpus's own format -- and answered **0 of 5**
naturally-typed questions. v79 gave each task four or five phrasings; v86 then
answered **14 of 18** hand-typed questions on the same harness
(`output/v85_measurements/natural_phrasing.json`). So phrasing variety is a
lever that has already moved once, by a large amount, for a corpus change that
cost nothing at inference time.

Four or five phrasings is still a template set. Every one of them is written in
the register of a physics textbook: capitalised, punctuated, units abbreviated,
the quantity named before its number. None of them is how the question arrives
in a chat box. This module widens each task to 12-15 forms that cover, per task:

* casual register and lowercase -- ``whats the force on a 12 kg object``
* contractions -- ``what's``, ``whats`` (the tokenizer's word pattern keeps
  ``what's`` as a single token, so a contraction costs the same as its word)
* missing punctuation, and question-first vs command-first order
* filler openers -- ``hey can you work out ...``
* polite framings -- ``please could you find ...``
* units long-form (``kilograms``, ``metres per second squared``) and short
  (``kg``, ``m/s^2``)
* the number before the quantity name (``25 kilograms accelerating at ...``)
  as well as after it (``the mass is 25 kg``)

## What is deliberately NOT touched

**The canonical query.** `build_omni_corpus.OmniProblem.canonical` is the string
handed to `nexus_solver`, and it is built from the parameters, not from the
phrasing. Widening this bank therefore cannot weaken verification: the oracle
still sees a form it parses, whatever the model is shown. That decoupling is the
reason it is safe to add register that no solver could ever parse.

**The response.** Every reply still ends ``total <number>``, still decomposes
inside the two-digit-by-one-digit envelope, and is byte-identical to the one the
same problem would have produced without this module. Only the question changes.

## Why the selection is a hash and not a draw

`build_scratchpad_math._prompt_variant_index` established the pattern in this
repository: choose the paraphrase from a hash of the row's identity so that
"enabling the arm never consumes the problem RNG and cannot silently change
operands, answers, or later rows."

The same rule here, for the same reason. `build_omni_corpus` still makes its
ordinary `rng.choice` over the narrow list, so the RNG stream is bit-identical
with the flag on and off; the narrow index it produces is then fed in as part of
the identity rather than used directly. A v87 corpus built with the flag on is
therefore a **single-variable** change from v86: same operands, same answers,
same worked responses, different prompt strings. If the score moves, phrasing is
the only thing that could have moved it.

A consequence worth stating: the identity is ``(task, narrow index, values)``,
so a given problem appears under as many distinct phrasings as the narrow list
has entries -- four or five -- not all fifteen. Across a task every phrasing is
seen with hundreds of different problems, which is what stops the model tying a
phrasing to an answer; and each problem is seen under several phrasings, which
is what teaches that the answer does not depend on the wording.
