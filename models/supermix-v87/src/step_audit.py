"""Locate the step where a worked reply stops being arithmetic.

Accuracy says a reply is wrong. It does not say *which* of the five or six
operations inside it went wrong, and for a model this size that is the only
question worth asking. This module reads a reply the way the benchmark's
extractor does -- as text, with no access to the generator -- and checks every
operation it can pin down against exact arithmetic.

Two kinds of step turn up, and the distinction is what this module exists for.

A **written** step states its own operands: ``70 x 5 = 350``. It can be checked
on its own, and a false one is an arithmetic slip at a known position.

An **unwritten** step is one the format performs without writing. Every
decomposed task in this corpus has one. ``multiplication`` emits
``70 x 5 = 350, 9 x 5 = 45, total 395`` and never writes ``350 + 45 = 395``;
``percent`` emits ``times 10 = 60.3, times 5 = 30.15, total 90.45`` and never
writes the sum either. The reply's final number therefore rests on an operation
the model had to do silently, and neither the corpus nor the benchmark has ever
recorded how hard those silent operations are.

`carry_load` scores an unwritten step by whether it needs a carry or a borrow,
because the partials a decomposition produces are usually disjoint in their
digits -- ``350 + 45`` touches the hundreds-and-tens and the tens-and-units, and
the tens column is ``5 + 4``, no carry -- and a carry-free sum is closer to
concatenation than to addition.

**That hypothesis was wrong.** `force`, `multiplication` and `voltage` carry in
a sixth of their silent steps and score 1.000; `two_step`, `power` and
`algebra_one_step` never carry and score below 0.45. The measurement is kept
because it is the one that ruled the idea out, and because the difficulty of a
silent step is still worth reporting even though it does not predict accuracy.

What the module found instead is in the verdicts. Sorting v86's 139 wrong
replies by where they first go wrong put seven tasks entirely in
``arithmetic_slip`` -- a false step at a known position -- and put `average` and
`percent`, the only two tasks whose format performs an operation without writing
it, in the column where every written step is true and the answer is still
wrong. See `docs/V87_WHERE_THE_POINTS_WENT.md`.

Nothing here executes generated text and nothing consults the generator: a
reply is scored from its own characters, so the audit applies equally to corpus
rows and to model output.

    Zero means the operands are disjoint in their digits and the result can be
    assembled column by column without any information crossing between
    columns. ``350 + 45`` is such a sum: the tens column is ``5 + 4``, which
    does not reach ten, so nothing propagates. ``54 + 72`` is not: the units
    column reaches twelve and the tens column must be told.

    The distinction matters because a decomposition's two partials are usually

    different columns -- and a model that can concatenate is not necessarily a
