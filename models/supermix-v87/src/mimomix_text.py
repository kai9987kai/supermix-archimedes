"""Text tokenisation and corpus construction for the v57 talking MiMoMix model.

V53 built a full decoder-only language model and never trained it on language.
Its API says so in its own docstring: the backends are randomly initialised and
their text is noise. This module supplies the missing half -- a tokenizer and a
corpus -- so `MiMoMixModel` can be trained to actually generate text.

## The tokenizer

`WordTokenizer` is a whitespace-preserving word tokenizer, not BPE. Each token
carries its own leading whitespace, so `"".join(tokens)` reconstructs the input
exactly and decoding needs no spacing heuristics. `assert_roundtrip` pins that.

It is deliberately simple because the corpus is: the local chat database uses
292 distinct word types across 4.6M word tokens. A subword vocabulary would buy
nothing on data with that shape, and byte-level would multiply the sequence
length by five for no gain.

**The vocabulary is the ceiling on what the model can say.** A word the
tokenizer has never seen encodes to `<unk>` and can never be generated. That is a
property of the available corpus, not a design choice, and
`vocabulary_report` reports it so the limit travels with the checkpoint.

## The corpus

`databases/llm_chat.db` holds 120,000 `(user_text, response_text)` pairs, 21M
characters. It is templated: 37,543 distinct responses over 120,000 rows. A model
trained on it learns to hold a turn in that register -- coding-assistant small
talk -- and learns nothing else. It has no world knowledge to learn from here.

Prompt tokens are masked out of the loss with `-100`, which
`torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` ignores by default, so the model is trained to
*produce* replies rather than to reproduce the user's own words.

    stride, so no compute is wasted on padding.

    That stride is blind to turn boundaries, and the cost is not small. Measured
    on the v63 corpus at ``sequence_length=128``: **56.0% of supervised tokens
    land in a block that does not contain their own prompt**, and 879 of 21,673

    is the same thing as teaching it to emit the corpus's most likely reply
    unconditionally.

    On a templated corpus that is nearly harmless -- the modal reply is usually
    the right one -- which is why v57 through v60 trained happily this way. On a
    corpus spanning several domains it is fatal, and it shows up exactly as
    observed in v62 and v63: fluent sentences, ignoring the prompt.

    ``turn_aligned=True`` gives every turn its own block, padded to
    ``sequence_length``, so no supervised token is ever orphaned from its prompt.
    It costs padding compute and drops turns longer than the block, both of which

    Pass a dict as ``stats`` to find out how many turns were dropped. The
    docstring above promised the receipt should record it and nothing ever
    returned the number, so an over-length task could vanish from training with
    no trace -- which is exactly how v67 lost its six-value ``average`` rows.
    Leaving ``stats`` at ``None`` keeps the old two-value return and the old

    866,748 x 128 x 2 tensors, so **1.78 GB** of the trainer's 4.44 GB
    footprint, on a 15.6 GB machine that was already 25.6 GB committed. It
    spent hours at 17 s/step against a 4 s/step norm, faulting its own corpus
    back from the pagefile.

    16,384 at the `--max_vocab` ceiling) and the -100 ignore label, and cuts
    that 1.78 GB to **0.44 GB**. int32 is the fallback for a vocabulary that
    would not fit, which still halves it.

    Batches are cast to long on the way into the model, which costs a copy of
    16 x 128 values per step -- nothing against the pagefile traffic it
    removes.
