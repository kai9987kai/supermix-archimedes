"""Train the v53 MiMoMix language model to actually generate text.

`docs/V53_MIMOMIX_ARCHITECTURE.md` is explicit that its own numbers prove the
mechanisms work and nothing about quality, because the backends are randomly
initialised: *"Their text is noise by design."* This script removes that caveat
for one corpus. It trains `MiMoMixModel` -- hybrid SWA/global attention with
learnable sinks, auxiliary-loss-free sparse MoE, multi-token prediction, and the
recursive thinking core -- on real dialogue, and writes a checkpoint the API can
serve.

What the result is, stated before any number: a **small domain-specific chat
model**. The corpus is 120,000 templated coding-assistant turns with 292 distinct
word types. The model learns to hold a turn in that register. It has no world
knowledge, because there is none in the data to learn, and a word outside the
vocabulary can never be generated.

Held-out loss is measured on rows the model never trained on, but the corpus is
templated and only 37,543 of its 120,000 responses are distinct, so a validation
row's response may still appear in training. That makes validation perplexity a
measure of fit to the template distribution, not of generalisation to unseen
language. The receipt records it under that name.

#: full scan of all 911,478 rows of `datasets/v80/v80_combined.jsonl` (the
#: forty longest responses per task, tokenized exactly), the longest reply each
#: task requires is:
#:
#:     momentum 99   work 97   arithmetic_series 97   wave_speed 96

#:
#: Seven of twenty-two tasks need more than 64 tokens. Sampling the generators
#: directly (400 draws per task) agrees: arithmetic_series replies are median
#: 82 / max 85 with 100% over 64, combination median 61 / max 66 with 22.5%

#: binds on replies that never terminate, which is exactly when a probe should
#: give up. Note the honest edge: the longest measured prompt is 30 tokens, so
#: a worst-case 112-token reply reaches position 142 against v80's 128-token
#: trained context. RoPE extrapolates rather than raising there, and the
#: alternative -- capping below the answer -- is the bug being fixed.
