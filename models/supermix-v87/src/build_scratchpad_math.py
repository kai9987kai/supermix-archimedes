"""v66: arithmetic that shows its working.

V65 removed the blocker that made arithmetic unrepresentable -- digits are now
separate tokens -- and the model went from emitting no number a quarter of the
time to always answering in the right format at roughly the right magnitude:
51.5 where the truth is 51.333, 374.8 where it is 349.8. Exact accuracy stayed
near zero.

That failure has a shape. Right magnitude with wrong digits is what a model
produces when it is guessing the answer in a single step instead of computing it.
The standard remedy is to make the intermediate work part of the target, so the
model learns a procedure it can execute rather than a mapping it must approximate.

The decomposition here is place-value, in two steps, chosen because it is always
arithmetically valid rather than merely usually valid:

    524 - 305  ->  500 - 300 = 200, 24 - 5 = 19, total 219
    504 - 309  ->  500 - 300 = 200, 4 - 9 = -5, total 195

The second case is the reason for the design. A column method needs borrow
handling and can produce negative digits that have to be carried; splitting into
hundreds and remainder cannot fail, because the two partial results simply add.
A generator that is right only most of the time would teach the model to be wrong
in exactly the cases that are hardest.

The final number of every answer is still the answer, so
`eval_problem_solving.py` scores these models unchanged and v65 and v66 are
directly comparable on the same benchmark.
