"""Generate a scientific training corpus, verified by the NexusMind solver.

## Why this exists

When asked to "deeply expand the model's knowledge" before v74, the honest
answer was that the corpus could not deliver it: the dialogue portion is 19.8%
one repeated fragment, and v74's ten task types are all synthetic arithmetic.
A model trained on that knows arithmetic and nothing about the world.

`nexus_solver.py` changes what is possible. It is a deterministic solver over
`Fraction`/`Decimal` covering mechanics, energy, fluids, thermodynamics,
electromagnetism, waves, chemistry, algebra, geometry and combinatorics, and it
emits a step-by-step derivation with a SHA-256 receipt. It is a **verified
knowledge source**, and it can be asked an unlimited number of questions.

So: generate scientific problems, work them out, and have the solver check
every single one. Any row whose worked answer disagrees with the solver is
dropped, not shipped. The corpus is correct by construction rather than by
assumption -- no previous corpus in this repository had that property.

## Two design decisions taken from earlier failures

**Phrasing varies, because v74 was format-brittle.** v74 scored 0.894 on its
benchmark and got 0 of 5 naturally-typed questions right, because every task
had exactly one template and the model learned the template. Here each task
carries several phrasings, and the one shown to the model is decoupled from the
canonical query handed to the solver. The model sees variety; the oracle always
sees a form it parses.

**The response never ends in a unit.** Answers are extracted as the last number
in the reply. `total 5 m/s^2` extracts as **2**. Every response therefore ends
`total <number>` with nothing after it, and units live in the prose before it.
This is the kind of thing that silently halves a benchmark score.

## What is deliberately excluded

Tasks whose answers are irrational are generated with rounded values and
verified against the solver within a relative tolerance, rather than exactly.
Where a task cannot produce a value a digit-level model could plausibly learn,
it is left out rather than padded with noise -- training on `294.1995` teaches
the shape of a float, not physics.

#: two-digit by two-digit product in a single jump, followed by `half of 3540 =
#: 1770`, a one-shot halving of a four-digit number. v81's rule is that every
#: intermediate must stay inside two-digit-by-one-digit products; both of these
#: are outside it, and the task scores 0.00.
#:
#: On, the even operand is halved *first* and `n` is capped at 19, so the only
#: product is at most `19 x 9` -- byte-identical in shape to the
#: `multiplication` task that scores 1.00.
#:
#: **This narrows the benchmark as well as the corpus**, because
#: `eval_problem_solving` calls these same generators. A combination score
#: measured with this on is NOT comparable with v80's 0.00, which was measured
#: over n in 4..60. It is the same trade c7041897 already took for
#: `kinetic_energy`, and it must be stated every time the number is quoted.

#: actually types -- casual register, missing punctuation, lowercase, long-form
#: units, filler openers, numbers before or after the quantity name.
#:
#: The measurement behind it: v74 had exactly one template per task, scored
#: 0.894 on its own benchmark and got **0 of 5** naturally-typed questions
#: right. v86's 4-5 templates per task took that to **14 of 18**. This widens
#: the same lever further.
#:
#: Safe to expand because the phrasing shown to the model is decoupled from the
#: canonical query handed to the solver, so verification is unaffected however
#: the question is worded. And `_pick` performs its narrow `rng.choice` on both
#: paths, so every operand, answer and worked response is bit-identical whether
#: this is on or off -- only the wording moves.

#:     molarity      0.667 -> 0.333
#:     acceleration  0.762 -> 0.571
#:
#: The reason is that the partial dividends are back-computed from the answer:
#:
#:     model:  6400 / 64 = 100,  420 / 64 = 5,  122 / 64 = 2
#:     truth:  6400 / 64 = 100, 1920 / 64 = 30, 192 / 64 = 3
#:
#: To write `1920` the model must already know the next quotient digit is 30.
#: The format is a valid presentation of a result, not a procedure that can be
#: executed forward, so the model invents dividends and divides them wrongly.
#:
#: `decompose_product` works because it splits an **input**, whose digits are on
#: the page. This splits the **output**. A decomposition helps only when every
#: step it adds is derivable forward from what is already written and inside the

#: whole 630-problem benchmark, 24 are the three division tasks -- `power` 15 of
#: 21, `acceleration` 6, `molarity` 3 -- and every one of them fails at the same
#: place, the single one-shot division step:
#:
#:     power = work / time, 5712 / 48 = 114      truth 119
#:
#: `DECOMPOSE_QUOTIENT` above already tried to split this and made it much
#: worse, because each partial dividend was back-computed from the answer. The
#: bar for any replacement is therefore the rule that failure established: every
#: step derivable forward from what is on the page, and inside the model's
#: arithmetic.
#:
#: What changed is the second half. v88's written subtraction is now reliable --
#: 4 of 147 carry-free steps false and 9 of 134 borrowing ones, against v87-era
#: rates of 0.104 and 0.186 -- and multiplication scores 1.000. Long division
#: rests on exactly those two operations, so it is viable now in a way it was
#: not when `decompose_quotient` was written.

#:
#: `subtract multiples` was rejected on the envelope, not the budget: it asks
#: for `16992 - 11800`, and `subtraction` trains on three digits. Long division
#: keeps 97% of its operands at three digits or fewer because each remainder is
#: bounded by ten times the divisor.
#:
#: What it still does not have is a training run. The digit estimate
#: (`48 into 91 = 1`) is the smallest one available -- one digit, against a

# 3b99a446cd533be9bc5f8ae57d1310b4 every published receipt is paired on; and
# `test_code_corpus.py` derives its 21-task fingerprint from that registry.
# Keeping the twelve where they are is what leaves all three byte-identical.
