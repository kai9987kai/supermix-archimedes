"""Generate an executable-Python corpus, verified by running the code.

## Why this exists

v86 scores 0.779 across 21 tasks and has **zero** coding ability, for the
simple reason that there is no code in the corpus. Nothing here has ever asked
the model to read a snippet.

Code is the cheapest thing in this repository to verify exactly: you *run it*.
That is the same contract `build_omni_corpus` has with `nexus_solver`, with
CPython as the checker instead. A generator builds a snippet from a template,
works the answer out step by step in the model's own format, and the
interpreter then executes the snippet it actually shows the model. Disagreement
drops the row.

The check is not circular, and it is worth being precise about why, because the
drop rate is 0.00% and a 0% drop rate usually means a verifier that passes
everything. The generator computes its answer with Python *expressions*
(`s + n * k`); the checker executes the *string it renders into the prompt*.
Those two agree only if the rendered snippet says what the generator thinks it
says. An off-by-one in a `range`, a variable renamed in the template but not in
the derivation, a loop bound written from the wrong parameter -- each of those
is a mismatch between expression and string, and each is caught.
`test_code_corpus.py` mutates a template and asserts the row is dropped, which
is the only way to know the checker is load-bearing rather than decorative.

## What the envelope allowed, and what it ruled out

Every constraint from V81_WHAT_THE_MODEL_CAN_LEARN applies unchanged, and two
of them removed whole task families before a line was written:

**Character-level string work is unlearnable here and is not attempted.**
`s = "banana"; r = s.count("a")` cannot be learned by this model at all: the
tokenizer's `[A-Za-z]+` rule makes `banana` a *single* token, so the letters
are not visible to the model in any representation. It would be a task whose
answer is a function of information the input does not carry. Counting *list
elements* (`len(words)`) is fine and appears in `code_index`, because each word
is its own token.

**Snippets are one statement per line and never nest more than one level.**
Tokens carry their leading whitespace, so `"\\n    x"` and `" x"` are different
symbols and a deeply indented corpus builds a parallel vocabulary of
indent-prefixed identifiers. The generators here emit exactly six line-initial
forms in total (`\\nfor`, `\\n    for`, `\\nwhile`, `\\nif`, `\\nelse`, `\\nr`),
all of them high frequency; `test_code_corpus.py` pins that set so a future
task cannot quietly widen it.

**Every intermediate stays two-digit.** Loop counts, steps and list values are
bounded so no running total passes 99 and no product leaves
two-digit-by-one-digit. `code_nested_loop` caps both ranges at 9 for a reason
that is easy to miss: `decompose_product` writes `10 x 7 = 70, 2 x 7 = 14` and
deliberately does *not* write the total, because that is the form that scored
0.93. That is fine when the product is the answer, and wrong when it is an
operand for a later step -- the model would have to carry an unwritten number.
So the outer range is single-digit and the iteration count is one written step.

## Repetition, and where this family is weakest

v74's multiplication task holds 712 distinct problems repeated ~56x and scored
0.93; the same operation with 24,000 unique problems scored 0.03. Distinct
capacity is therefore a design parameter, not an accident, and
`distinct_capacity()` reports it per task. At `--per_task 20000` the family
runs from 28x repetition (`code_divmod`) down to 3.9x (`code_index`), and
`code_index` is the one to narrow first if the family underperforms: its list
carries a distractor element that multiplies the prompt space without adding a
step to the procedure.
