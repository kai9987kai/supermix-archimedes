"""Independently check a maths reply against the question that was asked.

The session's central finding is that only a *checkable* answer resists
recitation: a model reproducing a remembered reply to a novel problem is simply
wrong, and no amount of fluency hides it. `eval_problem_solving.py` applies that
offline, over problems it generates itself.

This module applies it live, to whatever the user typed. It re-derives the truth
from the question and compares, so the interface can say "wrong, the answer is
905" instead of presenting confident arithmetic and leaving the reader to check.

It recognises only the shapes the models were trained on -- twenty-one of them
as of v82, one per task in the v80 corpus: nine arithmetic shapes from v74 and
twelve solver-verified science and mathematics shapes from v79/v80. Anything
else returns `None`, which the interface must render as *not checked* rather
than as correct: an unrecognised question is not a passed one.

Multiplication, division, sequence and two-step were added for v74, which
introduced those tasks. Before that a chat reply to "What is 47 x 6?" showed
NOT CHECKED -- the model's strongest tasks were the ones nothing verified.

**This module is not a verifier and must never be promoted to one.** It
re-derives an expected answer from a *pattern* in the question, not from a
parse of its meaning, so a question whose shape it half-recognises would get a
confident wrong verdict. `nexus_epistemics.ANSWER_VERIFIER_IDS` is the
allowlist of things permitted to certify an answer and it contains exactly one
entry, `grounding_runtime.finalize_grounded_response`; `answer_check` is
deliberately absent from it. The compound-expression trap in
`_is_compound_expression` is the concrete reason: "What is 2 + 3 * 4?" once
parsed as multiplication with expected 12.0 where the truth is 14, because a
lone `A * B` search found `3 * 4` and never saw the `+`. That is now refused
as NOT CHECKED, and `test_answer_check.py` pins it in both directions.

v82 coverage, measured over 840 prompts drawn from `build_omni_corpus.TASKS`
and `eval_problem_solving.GENERATORS` at seed 4242: 799/840 = 0.951 before the
v82 widening, 840/840 = 1.000 after, with zero confident-wrong verdicts in
either. Coverage is not accuracy of the *model*; it is only the fraction of
questions this module is willing to judge at all.

v93 adds eleven benchmark tasks and this module gains a parser for every
shape among them: five science and mathematics forms re-derived from the
question (`impulse`, `ohms_current`, `spring_energy`, `permutations`,
`final_velocity`), three code forms the existing `_code_trace` already runs
once its snippet-start pattern admits `r = sum(range(3, 9))`, and three
connectome lookups (`cns_type_count`, `cns_side_count`, `cns_pair_synapses`)
whose "re-derivation" is the same table lookup the corpus builder did, from
the CC-BY male-CNS arrays. Measured at seed 4242 over all 41 registered tasks:
1,640/1,640 narrow-template prompts parsed and 4,920/4,920 prompts over the
full natural-phrasing bank (held-out forms included), zero confident-wrong
verdicts in either. `_permutations` runs before `_combination_choose` because
"permutations of 9 things taken 2 at a time" contains `taken`, and the
combination reading would have returned 36 for an answer of 72.
